# DHIS2Retrieval
 Retrieving data from DHIS2 API

## Description

This code is in response to a colleague who requested a way to automate retrieval of data from the DHIS2 API. Their team had been retrieving data manually for insertion into Excel spreadsheet. This is the description of DHIS2 on its site [Ref1]:

>_The world's largest health information management system — developed through global collaboration led by UiO._

>_DHIS2 began in post-Apartheid South Africa and is now a global open-source project coordinated by the HISP Centre [Ref2] at the University of Oslo (UiO). More than 80 countries worldwide use DHIS2 for collecting and analyzing health data. 3.2 billion people (40% of the world’s population) live in countries where DHIS2 is used. DHIS2 is offered free of charge as a global public good._

## Dependencies

The only library needed is dhis2.py, which is a Python wrapper for DHIS2 API requests.
```
pip install dhis2.py
```
